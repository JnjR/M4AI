      AI is not magic. It is built on mathematical models. We can learn the models and use them for our purposes. This workshop will be a counterexample to the view that rigor and accessibility come at the cost of the other. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a philospher of science, my goal is to become a <code>critical thinker</code> about my topic of interest. As a policymaker, the reason is to become an effective actor in the world. Critical Thinking is about <code>logic</code> and <code>evidence</code>. The logic of AI for public health is mathematics and the evidence is the relevant public health dataset. This ensures that we <em>do</em> public health better.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main problem areas of machine learning are prediction, classification and clustering. For any one of these, the model has the form: 

      \[y = g(X)\]

      In this transdisciplinary workshop, participants can expect to develop an intuition for AI models at the level of the function. The difference is the specific function \(g\). For example, a prediction using a linear regression in one dimension is \(g(X) = w_{0} + Xw\). We will build to this point slowly, and move beyond it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, this is a workshop about applied mathematics: math that is in the way to solving a problem you care enough about solving to learn the math. A characteristic of math is that an equation, technique or concept will have applications far beyond the context in which they are first encountered. Enjoy seeing your fears recede as you build your math confidence.

    <h2 class="title">Motivation</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="docs__content">
    <p>
      From personal experience I know that, "machine learning is an obvious and direct motivation to learn mathematics" (Deisenroth et al., xii). What is more, a focus on solving important problems - like whether a disease outbreak will occur, when it might and at what scale - does much to support the dual goals of rigor and accessibility in math education. I hope that you will find that this workshop engages with, as a classic text on calculus promises, "ideas and problems [that are both] difficult and enticing" (Toeplitz, vii).
    </p>

    <p>
      As a Black-led workshop open to all that was created as a social justice intervention, we must acknowledge the nasty undercurrents of AI - including its roots in violence, oppression and control. We hope that the participants of this workshop will grow into critical and ethical users and developers of AI systems. This why I launched the <a href = "https://ai4d.info/">International Workshop on AI for De-escalation</a>, with 'Enhancing Human Security, Equality & Dignity as the theme this year. I hope this will continue the conversation about de-escalation by design instead of being an afterthought when automated systems misfire.

    <p>Professor of Computer Science and Engineering and a member of the Centre for Vision Research at York University. Working in the fields of visually guided autonomous robots and virtual reality, he has published over 150 research papers, including co-authoring Computational Principles of Mobile Robotics with Gregory Dudek and a series of co-edited books on human and machine vision with Laurence Harris.</p>

    <p>Professor Jenkin's current research interests include: work on sensing strategies for AQUA, an amphibious autonomous robot, and the understanding of the perception of self-motion and orientation in unusual environments including microgravity.</p>

    <br>

    <p><b>Tameka Samuels-Jones</b> <code>Faculty Sponsor</code></p>

    <p>Co-Director of the Centre for Research on Latin America and the Caribbean (CERLAC) and Assistant Professor. She teaches Corporate Social Responsibility & Sustainability and Justice, Governance & Accountability in the Global South.</p>

    <p>Her scholarly work includes publications on environmental crime, Indigenous law in Latin America and the Caribbean and regulatory law. Specifically, she conducts research on the role of legal pluralism on environmental governance among legally autonomous groups.</p>

    <p>She is dedicated to research which emphasizes inclusivity in the development of environmental policies and laws particularly in countries in the Global South.</p>
